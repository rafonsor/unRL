# unRL
unRL (AKA "_unreal_") is a set of libraries providing Reinforcement Learning algorithms written in pure Python or leveraging Jax.

The scope of RL algorithms considered is not yet defined, but meant to be broad. So, whether the prefix stands for "_universal_", (deep) "_unsupervised_", or simply "_(f)un_" is not important. For those looking for a polished deep RL library using Jax specifically, consider deepmind's Haiku instead.

__*NOTE*__: The `unrl` package is to be refactored from a library with pure Python implementations to one powered by PyTorch and NumPy.

## Compatibility
The target Python language version meant for backwards compatibility is `3.10`.
